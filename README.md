# MHC_House.finches
MHC gene analysis in house finches (*Haemorhous mexicanus*) and their association with *Mycoplasma gallisepticum* across U.S. and Mexico.

## Overview
This project investigates how variation in MHC genes may influence susceptibility or resistance to *Mycoplasma gallisepticum*, a bacterial pathogen affecting wild bird populations.

## Study Scope
- Host species: House finch (*Haemorhous mexicanus*)
- Geographic range: Populations sampled in the US and Mexico
- Focus: Genomic analysis of MHC gene regions and disease correlation

## Goals
- Assess MHC genetic diversity in different populations
- Identify associations between MHC genotypes and infection status
- Compare patterns across geographic and epidemiological contexts

## Tools and Data
- Genetic data: DNA sequencing of MHC loci
- Pathogen screening: PCR or qPCR for *M. gallisepticum*
- Analysis: Bioinformatics tools for sequence alignment, diversity metrics, and association studies
